# Linux netshow library

Abstracts network related information such as L2 info, LLDP, Network services
(ntp, dhcp, dhcrelay) into Iface Objects.
This covers, physical ports, bonds and bridges only. Designed to
work with a linux device that is configured as a switch, but can work on a
server.

pynetlinux and python-netiface doesn't quite do what I want.
